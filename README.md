> Convert any image into a vinyl group for **Forza Horizon 3, 4, 5, or 6**.

**Repo:** https://github.com/tokyubevoxelverse/ForzaDesigner6 · **License:** MIT · **Windows 10/11 x64**

## Install

1. Download `FD6.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/tokyubevoxelverse/ForzaDesigner6/releases).
2. Double-click — no installer, no admin rights. Windows SmartScreen → "More info" → "Run anyway".

Source build: Python 3.10+, `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is normally already installed; if FD6 fails to launch, grab it [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

## How to use

**Generate:**

1. Launch `FD6.exe`. Click **Upload Image…** and pick a JPEG/PNG.
2. Right panel: pick a **Profile** (`balanced` recommended) and **Stop at shapes** (1500 or 3000 typical).
3. Click **Start**. Watch the live preview rebuild your image. The JSON auto-saves next to your source image when done.

**Inject:**

1. Launch your target game (**Forza Horizon 3, 4, 5, or 6**) and open the Vinyl Group editor.
2. Load a vinyl group with **at least N spheres**, where N is the shape count of your JSON. Keep saved 1500-sphere / 3000-sphere templates for reuse — fastest path is a fresh untouched template.
3. In FD6: pick your target from the **Target** dropdown, click **Upload JSON**, then **Inject into [game]**.
4. Watch the dialog progress. **Do not click anything in FD6 or the game during injection** — interacting can reallocate the in-game memory mid-write and fail the operation.
5. When the status turns 🟢 green, the vinyl group has been painted with your shapes.

**Re-injecting onto an already-painted template** works too — the locator falls back to an RTTI vtable scan when the fresh-sphere fingerprint misses. Expect an extra 2–5 minutes on the first re-injection scan per game session; subsequent ones are instant.

## ✅ Do / ❌ Don't

- **Do** open the game's vinyl editor *before* clicking Inject.
- **Do** keep one or two sphere templates saved for fast re-use.
- **Do** wait for the green status — large-game scans can take minutes.
- **Don't** edit, add, delete, or move shapes in-game during an active injection.
- **Don't** click anything in FD6 during the RTTI fallback phase. Windows may label it "Not Responding"; it isn't — let it finish.
- **Don't** close the game mid-injection or run FD6 as admin.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Splash video hangs | Click anywhere or press Esc. A hard 30 s auto-skip is always active. |
| "No confident match" error | Vinyl editor not open, or template doesn't have enough spheres for the JSON's shape count. Load a bigger template. |
| Re-injection scan looks stalled | RTTI fallback phase can run silently for 2–5 min on a large game. The dialog resumes once a candidate is located. |
| Shapes offset or wrong scale | File an issue with the JSON, the source image, and a screenshot of the in-game result. |
| Game patched, all candidates rejected | The per-game struct offset may have shifted. Open an issue — the profile in `fd6/inject/game_profiles.py` needs updating. |

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m fd6                # run from source
pytest                       # run tests
.\build_exe.bat              # → dist/FD6.exe

## Credits

Inspired by:

- **forza-painter** by `the_adawg` (FH4/FH5 — MIT)
- **geometrize-lib** by Sam Twidale (MIT)
- **Primitive** by Michael Fogleman (MIT)
- **bvzrays**' publicly available [forza-painter-fh6](https://github.com/bvzrays/forza-painter-fh6) (MIT). FD6 uses his published research for: the CLiveryGroup struct field offsets, the (X, −Y) position convention and 63 / 127 scale divisors, the confirmation that FH5 and FH6 share the same struct layout (which made FH3/FH4/FH5 support feasible), and the MSVC RTTI vtable-scan locator approach (FD6's `rtti_locator.py` looks up `.?AVCLiveryGroup@@` by C++ type). FD6 does **not** ship or load community-distributed `forza-codes.dat` runtime pattern files — only the single baseline RTTI class name is hardcoded.

The FH6 vinyl-group memory layout was independently reverse-engineered from scratch for this project against FH6 build 354.221 and later cross-validated against bvzrays' research; the two derivations matched on every field offset. The sphere-template injection workflow (load a fresh sphere group → fingerprint-locate it in memory → overwrite each sphere's bytes in place) and the strict 5/5 + 95% full-table validation gate are FD6 originals; both stay as the **primary** locator path, with RTTI vtable scan as the **secondary** fallback for re-injection onto already-painted templates.
